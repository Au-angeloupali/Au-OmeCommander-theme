# Au-OmeCommander-theme
Clear and clean theme for OneCommander

V 1.0

Theme created for a clean, linear development environment. Some elements still do not have the desired appearance but I have not been able to fix them yet.

- Context menu CornerRadius
- Context menu spacer color
- Context menu border
- Context menu background alpha

Bug: 
The second level of the Context men√π have a tasparent background.
